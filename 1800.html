                        The nineteenth century was filled with war and revolution <br>
                        From the Napoleonic wars in the beginning of the century, to the American civil war<br>
                        Latin American independence, and the decline of the ottoman empire <br>
                        The industrial revolution created loads of low-paying jobs <br>
                        This century is filled with corsets, bonnets, top hat and huge skirts, for the rich, that is.

                        In this era women mostly wore dresses that were long, with an empire waistline. These styles differed greatly from those in the era's that surround it. 
                        The styles were inspired by ancient greek and roman styles. And accentuated the natural waist. 
                        Corsets were no longer used to create a desired shape or thin someone down, but were more used as bras, like we do in the present. 
                        Everyone wore casual dress, even during formal occasion. Hairstyles were very curly over ears and forehead, long hair was often pulled back into buns. 
                        Women still wore caps often, but for the first time in centuries women would leave the house without a cap, and not fear to be seen as a prostitute. <br>

                        The fashion in this time steered away from the regency styles of the decade before. Here the full skirts and visible coresting on the natural waistline.
                        Waistlines lowered throughout the decade, and the skirts slowy turned into a cone shape. Skirts became more decorated, with tucks, pleats, ruffles, and even fur. 
                        Later on in the decade women's sleeves began to turn into what would become trending in the 30's. 
                        In the beginning of the decade women wore a lot of tight curls. The bun became a looped knot on top of the head and the curls became looser. 
                        Women began wearing wide-brimmed hats covered in feathers or ribbon trim. Altough conservative women still wore caps. <br>

                       This marks the beginning of the victorian era, that would last until 1900, after which it would transform into edwardian dress. 
                       Women wore really big sleeves, above full cone-shaped skirts. Corsets were held in place with a lot of layers of stiff petticoat. 
                       All the bulk on the dresses was to make the waist look smaller than it was. This is the only thing left over from the regency era.
