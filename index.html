                    Hiya! My name's Julia, and I had to make this website for school. I couldn't think of a subject, so I decided on historical fashion.<br>
                    I've always had a big interest in historical fashion. As a kid I used to dream that i would go to balls and dance in those enormous dresses. <br>
                    Now that I am older, I have finally found an excuse to properly study the subject. I am an aspiring seamstress, but I really haven't found the motivation in myself to actually do something<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website will primarly be focussing on eurocentric fashion in the 18th to 20th century, as ths is the subject I am most interested in.<br>
                    Of course I am also obligated to mention the fact that this is the fashion that was usually common int the middele to upper classes, this isn't to say that the lower classes weren't fashionable <br>
                    It's just that the most extravagant clothing, and the clothing most documented were in the upper and middle classes.<br>
                    Especially in the 18th and the 19th century
