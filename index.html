                        Hiya! My name's Julia, and I had to make this website for school. I couldn't think of a subject, so I decided on historical fashion.<br>
                        I've always had a big interest in historical fashion. As a kid I used to dream that i would go to balls and dance in those enormous dresses. <br>
                        Now that I am older, I have finally found an excuse to properly study the subject. I am an aspiring seamstress, but I really haven't found the motivation in myself to actually do something <br>
                        Finally, excuse any spelling or language mistakes. Although I pride myself on my ability to speak and write English, it isn't my native language.
                    </p>
                <h3> Little about the website </h3>
                    <p>
                        This website will primarly be focussing on eurocentric fashion in the 18th to 20th century, as ths is the subject I am most interested in.<br>
                        Of course I am also obligated to mention the fact that this is the fashion that was usually common int the middele to upper classes. This isn't to say that the lower classes weren't fashionable. <br>
                        It's just that the most extravagant clothing, and the clothing most documented, were in the upper and middle classes.<br>
                        Especially in the 18th and the 19th century, only the rich were able to afford having portraits painted of themselves or their family members.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Everything on this website will also be adult female clothing, with maybe some teenage things. Male clothing is interesting, don't get me wrong, but it just isn't my forte. <br>
                        The website is seperated by century, as seen in the bar at the top. <br>
                        Each century is then divided into increments of 10 years, and the major fashion of these will then be described. <br>
                        Also, there is a tab called "references" here I've put some of my favorite (unoffical) costume historians, along with the links from which I've gotten my information from<br>
                        Because I find it important to give credit where credit is due.
