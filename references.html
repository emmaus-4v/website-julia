                    I find it important to give credit to people that both inspire me, as well as the people I get my information from. <br>
                    Here you will find links to these people as well as a little bit about the content they create. <br>
                </p>

                <h3>Bernadette Banner</h3>
                 <img src="afbeeldingen/bernadettebanner.png" alt="Picture of Bernadette's female historical sherlock costume" width="150px" class="img-zweefrechts">
                <p>
                    She studies history of dress, through reconstruction by hand (and with authentic machinery, where appropriate) <br>
                    She is the one who originally inspired me to sew, so I think it fitting she's the first on this list <br>
                    She works mostly on 10th century until pre world war 1 clothing <br>
                    <a href:"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHtaUm-FjUps090S7crO4Q">She has a youtube channel</a> <br>
                    <a href:"https://bernadettebanner.co.uk">And a website</a> <br>
                    <a href:""> And here's her instagram</a>

                <h3>Cathy Hay</h3>
                <img src="afbeeldingen/cathyhay.jpg" alt="The picture Cathy has used as her profile picture on Youtube" width="150px" class="img-zweeflinks">
                <p>
                   Cathy Hay is another youtuber I adore, she has a weakness for very old clothes <br>
                   Such as her ambitious project of restoring the Peacock dress (you can follow this project on her youtube channel) <br>
                   She also has a lot of videos about mental health, and the proper mentality for sewing without getting a burnout. <br>
                   <a href:"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWmQGoSY-lmWlakti_Br3cQ"> Here's the link to her youtube channel. </a> <br>

                   <a href:"https://www.instagram.com/cathy.hay/?hl=nl"> And her instagram</a> <br>

                <h3>Rachel Maksey</h3>
                <img src="afbeeldingen/rachelmaksey.jpg" alt="Rachel looking like an adventurer in a forest" width="125px" class="img-zweefrechts">
                <p>
                    This is another one of my favorites, Rachel focuses a lot on the 20th century. <br>
                    She is also a cosplayer and does a bit more "fandom" related things, not exclusively historical dress. <br>
                    One of my favorite series of her is "but make it vintage" Where she turns original costumes into vintage styles. <br>
                    <a href:"https://www.youtube.com/c/rachelmaksy/featured"> This is her Youtube channel </a> <br>
                    <a href:"https://www.instagram.com/rachel_maksy/"> And this is her instagram </a> <br>

                <h3>Morgan Donner</h3>
                <img src="afbeeldingen/morgandonner.jpg" alt="Morgan's medieval heraldic dress" width="100px" class="img-zweeflinks">
                <p>
                    This costume historian focuses more on the earlier centuries, not neccesarily on the ones I'm talking about today. <br>
                    She works with a lot of medieval things, but she doesn't exclusivley sew by hand. <br>
                    One of the other things she does a lot is trying to bring historical fashion into the modern wardrobe. <br>
                    <a href:"https://www.youtube.com/c/MorganDonner/featured"> This is her Youtube channel </a> <br>
