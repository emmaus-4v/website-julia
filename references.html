                    I find it important to give credit to people that both inspire me, as well as the people I get my information from. <br>
                    Here you will find links to these people as well as a little bit about the content they create. <br>
                </p>
                <h3>Bernadette Banner</h3>
                <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f3/54/69/f354693e34267451e217a15217474e3f.png" alt="Picture of Bernadette's female historical sherlock costume" width="100px" class:"img.zweefrechts">
                <p>
                    She studies history of dress, through reconstruction by hand (and with authentic machinery, where appropriate) <br>
                    She is the one who originally inspired me to sew, so I think it fitting she's the first on this list <br>
                    <a href:"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHtaUm-FjUps090S7crO4Q">She has a youtube channel</a> <br>
                    <a href:"https://bernadettebanner.co.uk">And a website</a> <br>
                    <a href:""> And here's her instagram</a>
                    She works mostly on 10th century until pre world war 1 clothing
                </p>
                <h3>Cathy Hay</h3>
                <p>
                   Cathy Hay is another youtuber I adore, she has a weakness for very old clothes <br>
                   Such as her ambitious project of restoring the Peacock dress (you can follow this project on her yotube channel) <br>
                   She also has a lot of videos about mental health, and the proper mentality for sewing without getting a burnout. <br>
                   <a href:"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWmQGoSY-lmWlakti_Br3cQ"> Here's the link to her youtube channel. </a> <br>
