                        The twentieth century saw a lot. <br>
                        From "la belle epoque" to the two world wars, with a quick pitstop at the sinking of the titanic. <br>
                        To the suffragettes and the computers, towards the end of segregation and the discovery of quantum physics<br>
                        And to keep up with the quick-changing pace of the world, the fashion changed rapidly too. <br>

                        This period of time is known as the edwardian era. And it is the last time that most of the women wore corsets. 
                        The rich did a lot of leisure sports, so the clothes had to change to allow for more movement. 
                        But still in Edwardian times, the most worn ooutfit was a tightly laced corset (They could still breathe!) A tight bodice and long skirts. Sleeves began to increase in size in the beginning of the 1900's

                        In modern day we mostly think of the 20's with the flapper dresses and geometric designs. There is of course some truth in this, but it certainly is not everything.
                        There were different outfits for time of day, age, class and professions. One of the other big trend were dresses with  loose straight fit that went jut below the knee.
                        Another one was the long pearl necklaces, fake gemstones and bold art deco colors.

                        Here we see what fashion looked like during the great depression. Rich women wore old holloywood glamour gowns during the evenings. Another popular clothing item for women of status was a winter coat that was lined with fur.
                        The almost "boyishness" of the previous decade was now completly gone. Shoulders were exaggerated with shoulder pads, large colloars and butterfly cap sleeves.
                        Factory made garments were in decline, because most people plainly didn't have enough money to buy new clothes and instead preferred to mend old ones.

                        Ah yes, the era of the swing dresses, my favorite. Tea length swing dresses were all the rage, paired with gloves and a petticoat. For the teenagers the poodle skirt was in high demand.
                        Another option for skirts were the pencil skirts and circle skirts of the time. Hair flowers, headscarves and small hats adorned the hair of these ladies.
                        Here we also see the infamous bullet bra, also known as "that one weird point bra"

                        Jackie Kennedy, the American first lady was a trendsetter here, with her tailored suit dresses. But this decade also saw hippy fashion, with it's psychedelic swirls, ethnic clothing, tie dye and flair pants.
                        Teens wore plaid mini or pencil skirts. Button-downs and chunky knit sweaters made up more of the casual outfits.

                        There was no dominant style in the 70's. There were tye die shirts, afros, long flowy dresses, maxi coats, and everything ranging in between.
                        Here we also see the rise of the band tee, as well as peasant blouses. People would decorate clothing at home with fringes, embroidery or patches.
                        There was also  a revival of the jewelry and accesoires worn back in the 1920's.

                        This is a decade of bold style. Bold colours, silhouettes, hair, and much more. Trends were versataile, like ripped tights and biker jackets. But also polished looking oversized blazers and poof skirts.
                        Currently the 80's are making a bit of a comeback, with shoulderpads and power suits. Most clothing was cheap and bright in this decade.

                       This decade is not as loud as the 80's. It took the past fashion and turned it into something a bit more "classy" or as some would refer to it "people dressed smarter". 
                       By hte middle of the decade the seventies made a comeback and teenage girls wore the same things their mothers would have when they were their age. The eighties were seen as tacky, and flashy, and women prefered calm and subdued
